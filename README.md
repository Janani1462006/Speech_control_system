# Home Automation System using Arduino (Speech Controlled)

This is a simple simulation of a Speech Controlled Home Automation System using an Arduino Uno. The system allows users to control a Fan and a Light through speech commands processed via a Bluetooth module and Android app (such as MIT App Inventor).

# Features

✅ Voice-controlled operation
✅ Turns on/off Light and Fan using speech
✅ Uses Bluetooth communication
✅ Works with Android phones (MIT App Inventor compatible)
✅ Ideal for beginners and smart home concepts

# Components Used

Arduino Uno
Bluetooth Module HC-05
Relay Module (or LEDs for simulation)
220Ω Resistors
Jumper Wires
USB cable for programming
Android phone with voice control app

# How It Works

The system receives voice commands via Bluetooth from an Android app. It maps the voice inputs to specific commands:

Say "Light on" → Turns ON the light
Say "Light off" → Turns OFF the light
Say "Fan on" → Turns ON the fan
Say "Fan off" → Turns OFF the fan
These commands are interpreted by the Arduino through the Bluetooth serial interface.

# Setup Instructions

Connect components as shown in the circuit diagram.
Pair the Bluetooth module with your Android device.
Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
Open the voice control app and issue commands.
Observe the LEDs or relays turn ON/OFF based on your voice.

# Applications
